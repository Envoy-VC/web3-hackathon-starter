# üõ´ Web3 Hackathon Starter

The Web3 Hackathon Starter Kit, or w3-starter, is a web3 dApp template designed to simplify the process of building hackathon projects. By eliminating unnecessary boilerplate code, this opinionated template allows you to focus on the core functionality of your project. This is my go to template for hackathons and I hope you find it useful as well.
